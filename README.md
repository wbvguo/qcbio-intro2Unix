Author: Wenbin Guo \
Last Update: 2022 Spring


## Description
This introductory workshop introduces the Unix command line and shell programming fundamentals, focusing on building practical skills for computational biology and data science. In this workshop, we will learn to utilize essential commands, navigate Unix-based systems, manipulate files, and automate workflows. Additionally, the workshop covers writing and executing basic shell scripts to enhance productivity and reproducibility. For registration information, please refer to this [link](https://qcb.ucla.edu/collaboratory/workshops/w1-intro-to-unix-command-line/)
